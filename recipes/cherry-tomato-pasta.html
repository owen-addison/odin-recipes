        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>75 ml olive oil</li>
            <li>2 garlic gloves <em>thinly sliced</em></li>
            <li>1kg cherry tomatoes <em>sliced in half</em></li>
            <li>1/2 tsp caster sugar</li>
            <li>1 dried ancho chilli <em>torn apart</em></li>
            <li>20g basil leaves</li>
            <li>400g fettuccine (or linguine)</li>
            <li>35g Parmesan <em>finely grated</em></li>
            <li>salt</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Put the oil into a large saut√© pan and place on a medium high heat. Once hot, add the garlic and fry for up to 1 minute, stirring a few times, until starting to caramelise. Add the tomatoes - carefully, so that the oil doesn't spit - along with the sugar, chilli and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Pour over 200ml of water and stir for 4 minutes, until the tomatoes are starting to break down and the liquid is bubbling. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook for about 1 hour, stirring every once in a while, until the tomatoes and ancho have broken down and the sauce has thickened. Stir in the basil and set aside somewhere warm.</li>
            <li>Fill a large saucepan with plenty of salted water and place on a high heat. Bring to the boil, then add the pasta. Cook for 10-12 minutes, or according to the packet instructions, until al dente. Drain the pasta and stir it together with the sauce. Divide among 4 bowls, sprinkle with Parmesan and serve.</li>
